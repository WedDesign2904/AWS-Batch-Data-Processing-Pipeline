# AWS-Batch-Data-Processing-Pipeline
Stores raw data in S3, uses Glue for ETL and schema cataloging, Athena for SQL queries, QuickSight for dashboards, and CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting, enabling scalable, cost-effective batch analytics.

[CSV (or) Raw Format] --> [S3 Raw Data] --> [Glue Crawler] --> [Glue ETL Job] --> [S3 Processed Data] --> [Athena Queries] --> [QuickSight Dashboards]
                     |                   |                                  |

**Tutorials**

- [Amazon S3 Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GetStartedWithS3.html)

  Amazon S3 acts as the data lake where all your files are stored. It stores the raw data you upload (for example, CSV files) and the processed data generated by your ETL jobs.

- [AWS Glue Crawlers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-crawler.html)

  AWS Glue is used to prepare this data for analytics ‚Äî first by discovering its structure using a Glue Crawler and then by cleaning and transforming it using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs. This ensures       your data is well-organized and ready for querying.

- [Amazon Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/using-athena-sql.html)

  Amazon Athena allows you to run SQL queries directly on the data stored in S3 without needing to set up a database. This makes it quick and cost-effective to explore and validate your data.

- [Amazon QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/welcome.html)

  Amazon QuickSight is used to build dashboards and charts, turning your raw numbers into meaningful insights that can be easily shared with teams or stakeholders.

- [Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/GettingSetup.html)

  Amazon CloudWatch collects logs and metrics from Glue jobs and Athena queries, helping you monitor performance and troubleshoot issues.

- [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started.html)

  IAM (Identity and Access Management) is used to manage permissions securely. It controls which users and services can access the S3 buckets, run Glue jobs, query with Athena, or view dashboards in QuickSight ‚Äî    keeping your data safe and access well-organized.
